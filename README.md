# SealSC: the Seal Smart Contract Cloud 

> It is smart contract platform for one-key compilation & one-key depolyment. 
> It provides customized implementations of contracts which you can deploy as-is your needs. 
> You can build decentralized systems cross-chains with it.

# Introduction

SealSC is a ont-key platform witch serives all blockchain developers. Our aim is To make the contracts be written and used easily and safely.  
There are too may blockchains currently. Developers are hard to choose one of the to build themselves decentralized applications(DAPP). 

* Developers can deploys a contract easily, even a beginner. 

* Developers can customize their contract by using SealSC.

* Developers can build theire DAPPs across-chains.
