# Introduction

SealSC is a ont-key platform witch serives all blockchain developers. Our aim is To make the contracts be written and used easily and safely.  
There are too may blockchains currently. Developers are hard to choose one of the to build themselves decentralized applications(DAPP). 

* Developers can deploys a contract easily, even a beginner. 

* Developers can customize their contract by using SealSC.

* Developers can build theire DAPPs across-chains.
